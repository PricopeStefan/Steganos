-To write at JPG/JPEG
"The main issue with both the aforementioned formats(BMP and PNG) is the space a typical file occupies on disk. Both are lossless formats, meaning that all the pixels of the image are actually specified(not computed) and that absolutely no visual information is lost during transit. This is why the Joint Photographic Experts Group came up with a new image format called JPEG (#insert some history, dates, persons, RFC etc.) (based on the abbreviation of their group name). JPEG is a lossy format, meaning that some pixels are not actually written on the disk in order to save space while still trying to resemble the original picture as much as possible. Due to the fact that this format was invented when computers were really slow and because we live in a society where high speed and a great reduction in used memory are more important factors than a small, unnoticeable to the human eye, quality loss, JPEG became the most popular image format and is now being used everywhere on the internet, even 28 years after it was created."
