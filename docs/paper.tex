%Abstract - small description of the paper
\begin{abstract}
Steganography is the science of concealing a piece of information within another piece of information without affecting the latter in a noticeable way and therefore alerting any intruders of the existence of the former. 
This paper presents both existing and new ways of embedding computer files and data into different digital multimedia formats as covert as possible while still allowing the encoded information to be retrieved at a later time without any significant losses.

\chapter{Conclusion}
In conclusion, I believe that steganography in modern multimedia is in a really interesting position: it is not advanced enough to win over cryptography and become the main pillar behind secure communications over unreliable networks and most likely this will never change since steganography by definition will always be slower because it relies on a carrier for securing the message instead of just securing the message itself. However is steganography still an extremely important method of protecting information such that only the entrusted parties that are aware of the used algorithms will be able to extract the hidden message. It is my belief that there are countless more steganographic innovations to be made in this field that researchers will discover in the future, expanding the number of applications that steganography has right now beyond digital watermarking or Capture The Flag challenges in hacking competitions. 

Taking a step back to look at the entire known history of steganography methods we can clearly see that it has evolved a lot: from the Roman Empire hiding messages on the shaved heads of their slaves, waiting for their hair to grow back and then send them away with important messages, to the modern day digital steganography that contains several impressive and complex algorithms in order to ensure high capacity and fast encoding/decoding processes. Given this evolution it is same to assume that more and more complex and well researched algorithms will appear in the future, bringing steganography closer to the spotlight of various information security topics and conferences.
